**Distance and Rotational Speed Analysis of Coaxial Rotors for UTHM C-Drone: A Summary**

**I. Study Overview:**

* **Objective:** Investigate the effects of propeller distance and rotational speed on the thrust generated by the coaxial rotor system of the UTHM C-Drone, a hexacopter designed to carry a 180kg payload.  The goal is to optimize the system for power efficiency and lift capacity.
* **Methodology:**  Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using Solidworks Flow Simulation were conducted on six CAD models: one single propeller and five coaxial rotor configurations with varying distances (200mm, 282mm, 300mm, 400mm, 500mm) between the propellers.  The simulations tested thrust at throttle percentages from 50% to 90%.  The Moving Reference Frame (MRF) technique was used to model propeller rotation.
* **Propeller Model:**  The study used the T-Motor U15XXL KV29 model, a 62-inch diameter propeller.

**II. Key Findings:**

* **Coaxial Rotor Performance:** Coaxial rotors generate more thrust than a single propeller, but less than double the thrust.
* **Propeller Distance:** Increasing the distance between propellers generally increases total thrust, primarily due to increased thrust from the upper propeller.  The effect is more pronounced at higher rotational speeds (above 1800 RPM).  The lower propeller's thrust decreases with increased distance due to increased wake turbulence from the upper propeller.
* **Rotational Speed:**
    *  If the lower propeller rotates faster than the upper propeller, the increase in total thrust is minimal.
    *  If the upper propeller rotates faster than the lower propeller, the total thrust increases significantly.  The upper propeller is the major contributor to thrust.
    *  The thrust increment ratio decreases as throttle increases, impacting efficiency at higher power levels.
* **Propeller Rotation Direction:**  Counter-rotating propellers (opposite directions) generate significantly more thrust than co-rotating propellers (same direction).
* **Validation:** Simulation results showed approximately a 40% average difference compared to the manufacturer's specifications for a single propeller, but the trends were consistent.  The focus was on comparative thrust across different configurations rather than precise absolute values.

**III. Recommendations:**

*  A propeller distance of approximately 400mm appears optimal based on the thrust generated.
*  Maintaining the same rotational speed for both upper and lower propellers is recommended for simplified control and balanced torque.
*  Counter-rotating propellers are more efficient for thrust generation.


**IV.  Conclusion:**

The study provides valuable insights into optimizing the coaxial rotor system for the UTHM C-Drone, highlighting the importance of propeller distance and rotational speed on overall thrust and efficiency.  The findings can inform the design and control of similar multirotor cargo drones.
